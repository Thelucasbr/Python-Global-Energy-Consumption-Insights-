# Python Global Energy Consumption Insights (2022)

This project analyzes energy consumption data from 2022 using Python. The focus is on identifying which countries lead in different types of energy: solar, wind, hydroelectric, fossil fuel, and nuclear.

## Objective:
To visualize and compare the top 5 countries by energy consumption in each category using a public dataset and Python tools.

## Highlights:
- Cleaned and filtered public dataset (World Energy Consumption)
- Created sorted visualizations for:
  - Solar Energy
  - Wind Energy
  - Hydroelectric Energy
  - Fossil Fuel Energy
  - Nuclear Energy
- Applied color-coding to highlight renewables vs. non-renewables

## Key Insights:
This project compares the top 5 countries in consumption of nuclear, solar,wind, hydro and fossil fuels.  
While fossil fuels still dominate, renewable sources like wind and solar are quickly growing in key economies.  
Nuclear energy, despite being efficient, still raises safety concerns in global policy discussions.
